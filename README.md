3. **Understand, don't memorize**: Focus on the logic, not rote learning
4. **Experiment**: Modify solutions and test edge cases
5. **Practice regularly**: Consistency builds skill
6. **Use the console**: Test code snippets as you learn

## 🔧 Running Tests

Each solution file includes test cases at the bottom. Simply run the file to see the output:

```powershell
node problem-XX-name/solution.js
```

Expected output will be shown in comments within the solution file.

## 📂 Old Structure (Deprecated)

The previous `javascript/` folder structure has been superseded by the new organized format. The old files are preserved for reference but the new structure is recommended for learning.

This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions for improvements are welcome:

1. Problem clarifications
2. Alternative solutions
3. Explanation improvements
4. Additional test cases
5. Bug fixes

## 📝 Notes

- All solutions are written in vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
